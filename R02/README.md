# Guidelines
1. If you use malloc, use free in the same function (unless you can't).
2. Any file you push must be formated to norminette standards.
3. Any functions used more than once by other functions by must be in its own file.
4. All function that have their own file must be named the same as the file.
5. All function names must start with ft_.
6. Only include the ft.h file, nothing else, if you want to include something else add it to the ft.h.
7. If you create a new c file, make sure you add it to the Makefile.
8. Only add function definitions that are used outside the file they exist in.
9. Comment your code so each function is explained.
